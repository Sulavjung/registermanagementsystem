## Register Management System Tech Stack

The Register Management System is built using a combination of backend and frontend technologies to provide a comprehensive and efficient solution for managing registers within an organization. The tech stack includes:

### Backend

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime that allows running JavaScript code outside the browser. It provides the server-side environment for building web applications.
- **Express**: A fast and minimalist web application framework for Node.js. It simplifies the development of robust and scalable APIs.
- **SQLite**: A lightweight and self-contained database engine. It is used for storing and retrieving register data.

### Frontend

- **React**: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React allows creating dynamic and interactive frontend components.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that provides a set of pre-built styles and utility classes. It enables rapid UI development and customization.

### Additional Tools and Libraries

- **npm**: A package manager for Node.js that manages project dependencies and facilitates the installation of required libraries and modules.
- **Webpack**: A module bundler that combines multiple JavaScript modules into a single bundle for efficient loading and execution in the browser.
- **Babel**: A JavaScript compiler that transforms modern JavaScript code into a compatible version for older browsers.
- **Axios**: A popular HTTP client library for making asynchronous requests from the frontend to the backend API.
- **React Router**: A routing library for React that enables client-side navigation and URL routing within the application.

The combination of these technologies provides a powerful and efficient solution for managing registers, offering a seamless user experience and streamlined workflow.
